Ai  avatar that can communicate with user on a video call similar to how heygen does ,

----
Creating an AI avatar that communicates with users on a video call, similar to how Heygen works, requires combining several technologies like computer vision, speech synthesis, speech recognition, real-time video processing, and deep learning. It involves integrating Python and Node.js for backend operations, handling real-time media streams, and using AI models to generate realistic avatars.

To build a similar AI-powered avatar system, we can break down the task into the following components:

    Real-time Video Streaming: To stream the video call from the user and show the avatar to the user in real-time.
    Avatar Generation: Using AI models (such as generative models like StyleGAN, or character animation models like MetaHuman) to create the avatar.
    Speech Recognition & Synthesis: For real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.
    Avatar Interaction: The avatar should respond to user inputs, both visually (via facial expressions) and audibly (via speech).

Here’s a high-level overview of how you might implement this in Python and Node.js.
Key Technologies:

    WebRTC: To enable real-time communication (video calls).
    TensorFlow/PyTorch: For AI model training and inference (if needed).
    OpenCV: For facial detection and tracking.
    Google Cloud Speech API/DeepSpeech: For speech recognition.
    Pyttsx3/Google Text-to-Speech: For speech synthesis.
    Node.js with Express & WebSocket: For handling real-time interactions between the client and server.

1. Real-Time Video Streaming (Node.js + WebRTC)

For real-time video streaming, you can use WebRTC along with Node.js to establish a peer-to-peer connection between the client (user) and the server, or between two users if you're building a multi-user video calling app.

Install WebRTC and Socket.io for real-time communication:

npm install express socket.io

Here is the Node.js server to handle WebRTC connections:

const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');
const fs = require('fs');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

// Serve static files (like HTML, JS, CSS for client-side WebRTC)
app.use(express.static('public'));

let clients = [];

// Handle new WebSocket connections
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('New user connected');
  
  clients.push(socket.id);

  // Handle signaling messages for WebRTC
  socket.on('offer', (offer) => {
    socket.broadcast.emit('offer', offer);
  });

  socket.on('answer', (answer) => {
    socket.broadcast.emit('answer', answer);
  });

  socket.on('candidate', (candidate) => {
    socket.broadcast.emit('candidate', candidate);
  });

  // Handle user disconnect
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('User disconnected');
    clients = clients.filter(client => client !== socket.id);
  });
});

// Start the server
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});

Client-Side WebRTC and Avatar UI

Here’s a simple HTML + JavaScript setup to interact with the Node.js server using WebRTC.

Create a folder public/ and place index.html and main.js inside it.

index.html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>AI Avatar Video Call</title>
  <style>
    #avatar, #user-video {
      width: 50%;
      height: auto;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>AI Avatar Video Call</h1>
  <video id="user-video" autoplay></video>
  <video id="avatar" autoplay></video>

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/socket.io-client/dist/socket.io.min.js"></script>
  <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

main.js:

const socket = io();

// Get user media (video)
let userVideo = document.getElementById('user-video');
let avatarVideo = document.getElementById('avatar');
let localStream;

// Get user's webcam feed
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })
  .then(stream => {
    userVideo.srcObject = stream;
    localStream = stream;
  })
  .catch(error => console.error('Error accessing webcam: ', error));

// WebRTC Setup
let peerConnection;
const config = {
  iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }]
};

socket.on('offer', (offer) => {
  peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(config);
  peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer));

  localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
    peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream);
  });

  peerConnection.createAnswer()
    .then(answer => {
      peerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer);
      socket.emit('answer', answer);
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error creating answer: ', error));

  peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
    avatarVideo.srcObject = event.streams[0];
  };

  peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
    if (event.candidate) {
      socket.emit('candidate', event.candidate);
    }
  };
});

// Handle answer and ICE candidates
socket.on('answer', (answer) => {
  peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer));
});

socket.on('candidate', (candidate) => {
  peerConnection.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
});

This code creates a simple WebRTC video stream where the local user's video is displayed in #user-video, and the AI avatar video is shown in #avatar.
2. Avatar Creation with AI

For the AI avatar, you can use pre-trained models such as MetaHuman from Unreal Engine or DeepMotion for motion capture and facial animation.

For demonstration purposes, let’s assume we have an AI avatar that can respond to users.

We will use a Python backend to handle AI responses and interactions. Here's how to integrate a basic AI avatar that uses speech recognition and synthesis to respond in real-time.
AI Avatar Backend in Python (Speech Synthesis & Recognition)

import pyttsx3
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize speech synthesis engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

def listen():
    # Initialize recognizer
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

    # Capture audio from microphone
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)

    try:
        query = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"User said: {query}")
        return query
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I couldn't understand. Could you repeat?")
        return None
    except sr.RequestError:
        print("Sorry, I couldn't connect to the service.")
        return None

# Example conversation loop
while True:
    user_input = listen()
    if user_input:
        if "hello" in user_input.lower():
            speak("Hello, how can I help you today?")
        elif "bye" in user_input.lower():
            speak("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            speak("I didn't quite get that. Can you repeat?")

3. Integration with Frontend (WebRTC + Python)

You can integrate the backend Python AI functionality (speech synthesis and recognition) with your video stream. For instance:

    Send voice commands from the WebRTC client (user) to the Python server.
    Use the AI backend to generate responses.
    The Python backend can generate synthesized speech that will be sent to the avatar on the video call.

4. Final Integration and Deployment

    Video Call: Set up a signaling server with WebRTC using Node.js (as shown in the Node.js code).
    AI Response: Connect the frontend with the Python backend (either using a REST API or WebSockets) to send user queries and receive AI responses.
    Avatar Animation: You can use 3D animation libraries or APIs like DeepMotion to animate the avatar's facial expressions and body language based on the AI's speech and the user's interactions.

Conclusion

This is a basic implementation to get you started with creating a real-time video call system where an AI avatar interacts with the user. The Node.js backend handles real-time video streaming, while the Python backend processes the speech input and generates speech responses. This can be expanded with more advanced AI models, better avatar animation, and more sophisticated user interaction flows to mimic platforms like Heygen.
